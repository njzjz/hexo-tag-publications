  annote =   {Combustion is a complex chemical system which involves thousands
    of chemical reactions and generates hundreds of molecular species and
    radicals during the process. In this work, a neural network-based molecular
    dynamics (MD) simulation is carried out to simulate the benchmark combustion
    of methane. During MD simulation, detailed reaction processes leading to the
    creation of specific molecular species including various intermediate
    radicals and the products are intimately revealed and characterized.
    Overall, a total of 798 different chemical reactions were recorded and some
    new chemical reaction pathways were discovered. We believe that the present
    work heralds the dawn of a new era in which neural network-based reactive MD
    simulation can be practically applied to simulating important complex
    reaction systems at ab initio level, which provides atomic-level
    understanding of chemical reaction processes as well as discovery of new
    reaction pathways at an unprecedented level of detail beyond what laboratory
    experiments could accomplish.},
